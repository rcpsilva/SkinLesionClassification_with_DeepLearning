#Deep learning for the skin lesion classification problem

This is my current attempt to learn PyTorch.

In order to do this I have chosen the skin lesion classification problem. The dataset used here is the training set avaiable at https://challenge.kitware.com/#challenge/560d7856cad3a57cfde481ba (Parte 3: Lesion Classification).


Most of the code in the notebooks was taken from https://github.com/falloutdurham/beginners-pytorch-deep-learning/. Here, it was simply tweaked to solve the sking lesion classification problem. 

Please refer to the following book for more details:
